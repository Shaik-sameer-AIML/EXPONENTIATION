# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find the exponentiation of a number.
Developed by: S.Sameer
RegisterNumber: 21003881
*/
```
def fun(k):
   
    print("Exponentiation of a given number:",k**2)

k=int(input())

fun(k)


## Output:
![output](https://github.com/Shaik-sameer-AIML/EXPONENTIATION/blob/main/exponential%20no..JPG?raw=true)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
